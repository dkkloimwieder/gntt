# Vanilla JS Implementation (Legacy)

This directory contains the original vanilla JavaScript implementation of Frappe Gantt.

**Status**: Archived - no longer actively maintained.

The main library has migrated to SolidJS. See the root `src/` directory for the current implementation.

## Running the Demo

The vanilla demo requires the built dist files. From the root directory:

```bash
pnpm build:vanilla
# Then open vanilla/examples/index.html in browser
```
